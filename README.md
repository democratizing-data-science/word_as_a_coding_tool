# word_as_a_coding_tool
This macro enables the use of word as a coding device, substituting NVivo, Atlas.ti, RQDA, etc. 
The macro exports all comments (i.e., codes) and their content (i.e., quotes) to a new document in a table form.
This table can then be used with MOVIE or GRATIS to analyze the temporal evolution of those codes.
Page numbers, unit ID and coder information is included.
